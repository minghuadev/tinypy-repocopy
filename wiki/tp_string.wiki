`tp_inline static tp_obj tp_string(char const *v) `


Creates a new string object from a C string.


Given a pointer to a C string, creates a tinypy object representing the
same string.


*Note* Only a reference to the string will be kept by tinypy, so make sure
it does not go out of scope, and don't de-allocate it. Also be aware that
tinypy will not delete the string for you. In many cases, it is best to
use [tp_string_t] or [tp_string_slice] to create a string where tinypy
manages storage for you.
